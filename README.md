# 99 Problems

_I've got 99 problems but OCaml ain't one_

## Learning OCaml

This repos is about making the classic FP "99 problems in _language_", which is a list of increasingly difficult tasks to get familiar with a new language.

The page is not named like that anymore for OCaml, but it's heavily inspired by it.

You can find it [here](https://ocaml.org/exercises)
